1. Regression is a simple concept where sometimes we wish to find a fitted model to a given dataset and turn it out as a usefull
   tools to serve us on doing some techniqcal task. For examples, we can fit a curve to describe the relationship between the 
   Voltage and the temporature of a heater, that is when we find a regression form of the heater model. More clearly, if the model
   or the curve fits fairly well (such as satisfy some mathematical requirement like least squares or maximum aposteriori estimate) 
   we wish to see an unbiased model.

2. By the way, one of the reasons that I like to learn machine learning is because I took the Advanced Signal Processing subject in
   the last semester of my Melbourne uni study period. And I had the opportunity to learn and understand theory of a regression method.
   What I know around the most learners is that most of them can use the machine learning tools very well such as Python and other library.
   But sometimese and somehow thery don't need to necessarily understand the behind theory math of what they are using. And My opinion
   is actually every software tools must have a mathematical meaning behind it. It can only make sense when we understand the real picture
   that we can utlise a tool very well, because it will make things more flexible and can allow us to follow an engineering step: 1. Encou-
   nter a problem 2. Solve that problem.
   
 3. The 1. Regression py file covers the 1st-4th videos contents of sentdex, it mainly describe how to kick-start to train a simple 
    classifier with the given data, where we can formulate a group of features(material) and labels(product). However, there is not
    enough explanation in these first 4 videos, but I think it's interesting enough.
    
 4. Python package are used in this prject: 1. quandl(for grabing useful data set on the Internet);
                                            2. Pandas(haven't used)
                                            3. sklearn(a training data generator, 'I think so')
