# Machine-Learning-Notes
This repository contains the study notes on my machine learning course on the Internet
Hi, there.
I am a electronic guy, but I know it tends to be that the IT area is goint to be or 
have already been hot now. This is way I decide to access Machine learning and AI
courses. Currently, I am following the YOUTUBE course: Practical Machine Learning Tutorial with Python
supported by the streamer called 'sentdex'. And I am gonna take some notes periodicly to this place
and share some progress I've made on the experiment. Machine learning is always a cool stuff that 
every IT and Engineering student want to give it a try. And it is obvious that it gives some sweet
in seeking a proper job. Thanks and Good luck.
